/*
 Welcome to Java Tutorials
 In this part of the tutorial I am going to introduce you to the basic composition of a
 Java program. Below you'll see a basic program that does nothing.

 At line [#] is the package which is responsible for the file system structure of
 your java program, but don't worry if you do not understand it, it's ok to not
 even put it there.

 Starting form line [#] to [#] is a comment, java ignores all the comments and
 is used only for people (For documenting codes). You'll know it soon enough so
 don't be afraid if you are not catching up with me.

 At line [#] is the class declaration.
 The syntax of declaring class is as follows
[visibility] class [class/file name]
In this case, our filename is main.java there for our class name should be main.

package part_1;

/**
 *
 * @author systemzero
 */
public class main {
		public static void main(String[]args){
				
		}

}
